Widget Toolkit for HTML5 Canvas

* We can build widgets from panels.
* The panels represents a rectangular area of the graphical interface.
* The panels use global coordinates for events and painting while components use the local ones.
* The `app` and `canvas` are reserved names.
* The frame provides a full window canvas.

## Splits

The layout management primarily provided by splits.

* We can use the `VerticalSplit` and the `HorizontalSplit` classes.
* The splits manage two panel instances.
* The splitter position is in pixel.
